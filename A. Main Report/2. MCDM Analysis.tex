\section{MCDM Analysis}

\subsection{Introduction}
In the design of any process, crucial decisions need to be made from the offset. Whilst in many simple cases the team of engineers at Solution A Ltd are able to use good engineering judgement to determine the best course of action, there are certain decisions for which more detailed analysis is needed. Decisions with a large impact on the final process may involve several alternatives, each with their own merits and pitfalls. Multi-criteria decision making methods provide a formal and detailed tool to address these decisions, allowing Solution A Ltd to select the process route that best suits the needs of our clients and our ethos.
