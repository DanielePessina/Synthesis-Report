It aims to enable the capture of unavoidable process CO2 from limestone calcination for no energy cost and no extra capital cost (apart from compression). It is being developed by a consortium in a €21 M five-year Horizon 2020 project. A 240 t/d pilot will be built at HeidelbergCement's plant in Lixhe, Belgium, demonstrating that 95% of a plant's process CO2 emissions could be captured (around 60% of a plant's total direct CO2 emissions), and on-going R&D activities are reducing the uncertainties and risks involved.},

The solid and liquid effluents from the soda ash production have been a target of investigation since decades or centuries, often attempting to make use of the wastes. In this paper, all sources of waste from the Solvay Process and their environmental impact are reviewed and possible applications are discussed. It could be shown that, upon disposal into waterways, solid and insoluble wastes have a much higher environmental impact than salt solutions. The results of this study allow the conclusion, that cleaner production in this field can be achieved primarily by the use of cleaner raw materials or by technologies aiming at the avoidance of (solid) wastes or at the increase of the conversion rate of the raw material sodium chloride, whereas the utilization of by-products made from the industrial wastes often faces technical or economical problems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolutions of the processes parameters (flows, composition, temperatures, pressures etc.) were studied during the synthesis steps: ammonia absorption into brine, carbonation process of ammoniacal brine and recovery of ammonia from the process wastewater. The simulation results were compared with real plant operation data in order to validate the applications. From the comparison, one can observe a close similarity between simulation results and the real plant data. This fact validates the applications developed for process simulation and proves the utility of the model in analyzing and optimization of the real plant operation.},

   abstract = {A laboratory-scale solar reactor prototype dedicated to calcination processes of non-metallic mineral particles is tested and characterized. The prototype consists of an indirect heating shallow cross-flow fluidized-bed reactor-receiver. It is composed of 4 compartments in series in which the particles are thermally treated with solar power in order to drive the endothermic calcination reaction. The particles are fluidized in the reactor with preheated air and are heated up to 800 °C through the front wall of the reactor receiving the concentrated solar flux (about 200 kW/m2). The tests are carried out at the 1-MW Odeillo's solar furnace (France). The thermal decomposition of a continuous stream of 9.4 kg/h of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) is investigated in this paper. The half decomposition of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2 → CaCO3 + MgO + CO2) is performed with a degree of conversion of 100\%. The complete decomposition of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2 → CaO + MgO + 2CO2) is not reached because, with respect to the CO2 partial pressure in the reactor, the temperature of particles is not high enough to decompose the calcium carbonate. The calculated thermochemical efficiency (i.e. the energy absorbed by the endothermic calcination reaction compared to the solar energy provided to the system) is 6.6\%. This low efficiency is neither surprising nor critical since the reactor design was not optimised with respect to energy efficiency but designed to the control of particle flow and front wall solar flux distribution. A numerical model considering the 4 compartments of the reactor as 4 ideal continuous stirred tank reactors in series is developed. The model accounts for the mass and the energy balances, as well as the reaction kinetics of the half decomposition of dolomite. The model gives consistent results compared to the experimental data. These results are a proof of concept of continuous calcination reaction using concentrated solar energy in a cross-flow fluidized-bed reactor.},

Both processes rely on CaCO3 as common feedstock, enabling the reutilisation of purged calcium looping sorbent in the cement clinker manufacturing process. Thus, setting new boundary conditions for the calcium looping process. So far, calcium looping CO2 capture has been demonstrated at semi industrial scale for fossil fuelled power plants but not yet for cement plants. In this work, results obtained from University of Stuttgart's 200 kW calcium looping pilot plant investigating the so called tail-end calcium looping cement plant integration are presented focusing on the carbonation reactor. Different integration levels between the cement plant and the calcium looping process were assessed investigating make-up ratios up to 0.9 mol mol−1 and CO2 concentrations up to 0.33 m3 m−3. Operation at high sorbent make-up rates or high integration levels enhanced the sorbent's CO2 carrying capacity whereas for low integration levels the sorbent activity converged towards its residual CO2 carrying capacity. For high sorbent make-up flows, CO2 capture was limited by the carbonation equilibrium yielding CO2 capture rates as high as 98\% in the carbonator at carbonation temperatures around 600 ∘C, whereas for low integration CO2 capture was limited by the active amount of CaO being fed to the carbonator. The active space time carbonator model was applied with satisfactory agreement to the conducted experiments indicating the model's validity for calcium looping CO2 capture from cement plant. The obtained results emphasise the suitability of calcium looping CO2 capture for the decarbonisation of the cement sector.},

The critical issue in such an extrapolation remains to be mixing and hydrodynamic characteristics. It needs reliable similarity criteria that would result in similar mixing and hydrodynamics and hence transport and performance in two different scales. Numerous experimental and computational studies have been performed to investigate the flow behavior of bubble column reactors for a proper design and scale-up. Experimental techniques vary from simple visual observation to more advanced noninvasive diagnostic techniques. On computational front the progress has been made from simple reactor models to fundamentally based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Such studies ultimately provide a knowledge that help in understanding the hydrodynamic and mixing characteristics of these reactors and would aid in its scale-up. Based on these studies, various methodologies have been proposed in literature for scale-up and/or to maintain their hydrodynamic and mixing similarity. This article attempts to review the current state of reported dynamic similarity and scale-up methods of bubble column reactors. It mostly covers the methods reported in open literature.

These results suggest that gas mass transfer, pore diffusion and chemical reaction were all contributing resistances in the model. The calcination temperature and the water vapor partial pressure are the two most important variables that affect the hydration rate of lime. The higher the calcination temperature, the lower the hydration rate and the higher the water vapor partial pressure, the higher the hydration rate.

   abstract = {The present work evaluates a new process for the capture of CO2 and the reduction of water salinity. It is based on the Solvay process without the use of ammonia and involves the reaction of CO2 with saline water such as reject brine in the presence of calcium hydroxide. The effects of operating parameters such as reaction temperature, water pH and reaction stoichiometry on CO2 capture efficiency and sodium removal were examined for both traditional and modified Solvay process. The optimum conditions for maximum CO2 capture efficiency and sodium removal were determined using response surface methodology and were found to be at temperature of 20 C and a pH of greater than 10 for both processes. At the optimum conditions, CO2 capture of 86% and 99% and sodium removal of 29% and 35% were achieved for the traditional Solvay and the Modified process, respectively. The water pH was found to be a key parameter in the effectiveness of the reaction process; higher pH leads to better process performance in both CO2 capture efficiency and sodium removal. The experimental results clearly illustrated that the Modified Solvay process is superior in terms of CO2 capture efficiency, sodium removal and energy consumption.},

   abstract = {Water desalination plants produce huge amounts of reject brine, which are usually sent back to the sea, where they could, in the long run, result in detrimental effects on the aquatic life as well as the quality of the seawater in the area. In this study, a new approach for the management of desalination reject brine and capture of CO2, where ammoniated brine is reacted with carbon dioxide, has been investigated. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, and excess ammonia were assessed. Carbon dioxide was used either as a pure gas or a mixture of 10% CO2 in methane. The experimental results indicated that the optimum reaction temperature was about 20 C and the optimum NH3/NaCl ratio was 2 for synthetic brine solutions and 3 for actual reject brine. The proposed process proved to be effective in reducing the CO2 concentration in a CO2 CH4 gas mixture by more than 90%. The solubility of sodium bicarbonate was found to play a key role in the removal of sodium. The results indicated that the new approach can reduce the salinity of reject brine and, at the same time, contribute to the reduction CO2 emissions.},

   abstract = {Several different carbon-capture technologies have been proposed for use in the cement industry. This paper reviews their attributes, the progress that has been made toward their commercialization, and the major challenges facing their retrofitting to existing cement plants. A technology readiness level (TRL) scale for carbon capture in the cement industry is developed. For application at cement plants, partial oxy-fuel combustion, amine scrubbing, and calcium looping are the most developed (TRL 6 being the pilot system demonstrated in relevant environment), followed by direct capture (TRL 4−5 being the component and system validation at lab-scale in a relevant environment) and full oxy-fuel combustion (TRL 4 being the component and system validation at lab-scale in a lab environment). Our review suggests that advancing to TRL 7 (demonstration in plant environment) seems to be a challenge for the industry, representing a major step up from TRL 6. The important attributes that a cement plant must have to be "carbon-capture ready" for each capture technology selection is evaluated. Common requirements are space around the preheater and precalciner section, access to CO 2 transport infrastructure, and a retrofittable preheater tower. Evidence from the electricity generation sector suggests that carbon capture readiness is not always cost-effective. The similar durations of cement-plant renovation and capture-plant construction suggests that synchronizing these two actions may save considerable time and money. ■ INTRODUCTION Unlike most industrial processes, process chemistry rather than fuel combustion is responsible for almost two-thirds (64%) of the CO 2 emissions emanating from the Portland cement industry. 1 As shown in Figure 1, around 880 kg CO 2 is generated per tonne of clinker in a typical (1 Mtpa, 3 000 tpd) cement plant, 2 which produces CEM I (95% clinker). The cement industry is likely to play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat anthropogenic climate change. Many decarbonization pathways suggest that direct specific emission levels of around 350 − 410 kg CO 2 /t cement will be required. 1,3 However, increasing clinker substitution, alternative fuel use, and thermal energy efficiency 1 can only lead to specific emissions per tonne of cement falling from 730 kg CO 2 /t cement in 2009 to about 540−590 kg CO 2 /t cement in 2050. Alternative, lower CO 2 intensity cements have been suggested, but uptake is not expected to be anywhere near the levels required if the sector is to meet these targets. 4 Many NGO-based analysts, such as the IPCC and IEA, agree that the main technology group able to achieve the remaining required emission reductions is carbon capture and storage (CCS), 1,5 owing to the relatively high concentration of CO 2 in the flue gas from these large, point-source emitters. 6 Estimates suggest that the Spanish cement industry could reduce its specific direct emissions by only 21% between 2010 and 2050 without CCS, 7 and that the U.K. cement sector absolute CO 2 emissions could be reduced by 66% in the 1990 to 2050 period if CCS is not available but by 81% if it is. 8 However, none of the 45 large-scale CCS projects in design, construction, or operation involves the cement industry. 9 Most operating carbon-capture plants are in natural gas processing, 9 but by 2050, seven industrial sectors could account for about half of CO 2 emissions avoided by CCS. 10 Commercial-scale application of the technology in the cement industry is seen by most as being five to ten years away at best and that few, if any, carbon capture plants will exist before 2030. 11−17 Little research into the practicalities of installing the capture plant at a cement plant, particularly in the case of retrofitting, has been published. 18−20 A lack of effective policy drivers (such as a substantial carbon price, effective strategies to address carbon leakage, and promotion of access to capital) is limiting progress and impeding commercial-scale demonstration. 11,19,21 An estimate that a failure to develop CCS for industrial applications could increase climate policy costs globally by 221 bn € 2013 /year by 2050 13 illustrates the importance of the technology to the cement sector and other energy-intensive sectors.},

   abstract = {A thermal gravimetric method was used to measure rates of decomposition of NAHCO, particles. Such decomposition produces a highly porous Na,Co, that reacts with SO, rapidly and completely at moderate temperatures. Hence, NaHCO, decomposition provides a reactant with attractive features for SO, removal. The rapid rate of decomposition combined with the high heat effect prevented determining intrinsic rates by constant temperature runs when the temperature level was above 400 K. However, rising-temperature runs, which allowed time for heat transfer to equilibrate temperatures of the thermocouple and particles, gave reliable results at high temperatures. The activation energy was 102 kJ/mol. Porosimeter data verified the large increase in pore volume (from 0.03 to 0.39 x lo-, m3/kg) on converting the NaHCO, particles to Na,CO,. First-order kinetics were observed up to high conversions, after which the apparent order decreased. However, the sodium bicar-bonate could be completely converted to Na,CO,. SCOPE It has been well established that thermal decomposition of NaHCO, particles can produce a highly porous Na,CO, product that reacts rapidly with SO, in waste gases (Bares et at., 1970; Marecek et al., 1970). Also, rates of decomposition and of reaction with SO, have been measured separately on different samples (Sub-ramanian et al., 1972; Guarini et al., 1973; Bares et al., 1970; Marecek et al., 1970). Our objective was to determine the rate of decomposition of a sample of NaHCO, particles at temperatures from 373 to 473 K over the complete range of conversion. A TGA apparatus was employed since this allowed very small sample masses to be used (leading to accurate rates) and the effect of heat and mass of transfer processes could usually be eliminated. Pore-volume data also were obtained on NaHCO, and Na,CO, particles. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE The rapid rate of decomposition of NaHCO, combined with a large, endothermic heat effect required careful choice of operating conditions to obtain rates unaffected by heat transfer. At temperatures above 400 K this required the TGA experiments to be conducted by the rising-temperature method. The results showed that intrinsic kinetics were first-order in mass of NaHCO, up to high conversions. The retardation of the rate beyond this point may be due to changes in the},
